LearningAPIs

Working with APIs
API stands for Application programming interface
APIs are a way for applications to talk to eachother
In python we use the requests package to handle the connection
Note: It is requests with an s not request(this is a different package)
Most API's communicate with data in the form of JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
